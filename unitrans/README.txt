INSTRUCTIONS (Without Bus Stops)
******************************************************************************************************************************************************
NOTE: There are 2 sets of instructions, 1 for using the visualization without bus stops and 1 for using it with bus stops.

After the data has finished loading, you will be presented with an initial visualization showing boarding information for all of the bus lines. From 
here, you are free to select any combination of "Bus Lines", "Days", and "Hours". You will also be able to select "Stops" but there's a couple things
about that that I will mention in the next section which you should read so that you know what to expect.

The visualization will display different information based on the options that are selected. The more options that you choose, the more detailed the
information displayed by the visualization will be. This is also dependent on how many option you choose under each section. The fewwer options that
you select, the more detailed the information will be displayed for the options that are selected. After selecting all of the option you want, click on
the Apply button to see the changes.

For example, if you check the "Boardings" box, select lines J and G under "Bus Lines", along with days 1, 2, and 3, and a timespan from 10am-12pm, the 
pie will be divided into 2 sections based on the G and J lines. Each section will display the aggregated information based on the options that were 
selected. In this case, it will display all of the boardings for the G and J lines that occured on October 1,2,3 from 10am-12pm. Now with these options
still selected, this time unselect one of the bus lines and hit "Apply". After doing so, you will see the Pie display more detailed information based 
on the 3 days that are selected. Similarly, if you select only 1 of those 3 days and hit the "Apply" button, you will see the Pie transform once again. 
This time, it will show you information based on the 3 times that were selected.

BUS STOP INSTRUCTIONS
******************************************************************************************************************************************************
When you first select a bus stop, the Pie will initially show boardings for all bus lines for all of October. Once you have selected a particular stop,
you're able to make more detailed selections based on the other options available. In addition, selecting a bus stop will disable the ability to select
bus lines that don't make that particular stop. In order to go back to selecting other buslines, select the blank stop and the very top to enable all 
bus lines.
